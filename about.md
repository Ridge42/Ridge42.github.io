## Background

Hi! My name is Ridge Atwood, and I am currently a junior at Brigham Young University majoring in Statistics with an emphasis in Data Science. I plan to enter the BYU Master’s Program in Data Science in Fall 2026.

My passion for data science comes from my love of problem solving, working with data to uncover insights, and an early interest in computer science. A mentor introduced me to data science as the perfect combination of both fields, and I’ve been excited about it ever since.

My career goal is to work in the financial industry, using data-driven decision making to improve financial strategies and outcomes.
