    "text": "Summary of Data Collection Process\nTo collect my data, I used the MangaDex REST API, which returns JSON-formatted data for manga series. Getting started required just a few lines of Python using the requests library. The overall process can be summarized in four main steps:\nIdentify an API endpoint. MangaDex provides endpoints like /manga to retrieve metadata for many titles at once. The official documentation lists query parameters (such as genre, publication status, and rating order) that make it easy to pull a wide variety of series.\nMake API calls with requests. In Python, I used:\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://api.mangadex.org/manga\", params={\"limit\": 100})\ndata = response.json()\nThis returns a structured dictionary containing details for each series, including title, description, tags, publication status, and relationships (e.g., authors).\nExtract and clean relevant fields. Each manga entry contains nested attributes, so I parsed out features such as:\nTitle\nAverage rating\nNumber of followers\nStatus (ongoing/completed)\nGenres/tags\nYear started These variables form the backbone of my dataset.\nStore and combine results. I looped through multiple API pages until I had well over 200 unique manga and manhwa entries. The cleaned data was then stored in a CSV file for later analysis using pandas.\nFor anyone wanting to try something similar, the MangaDex API is an excellent place to start. It’s free, openly documented, and returns rich metadata with minimal setup."

    "text": "Characteristics\n\nMatplotlib\n\nFoundational library\n\nOther graphing libraries are based off the matplotlib library. Even using other graphing libraries such as seaborn, you still need to import matplotlib and use some of its functions.\n\nFlexible but verbose\n\nIts flexible in the many different features availbale, but it requires you to type a lot of code just to even label the graphs. It can’t all be done in the same line, you have to specify specific functions each time which can be time-consuming and repetitive.\n\nDefault look is plain\n\nThe default look is very basic. If you want color and better backgrounds, you will have to specify it.\n\nGreat for fine-grained customization\n\nYou can change every little thing with the graph allowing you to get the exact graph you want.\n\n\n\n\nSeaborn\n\nHigh-level interface built on Matplotlib\n\nSeaborn is built on top of Matplotlib, so it can use Matplotlib functions when needed, but it automates many common tasks like styling, grouping, and legends.\n\nPolished style defaults\n\nUnlike Matplotlib’s plain default look, Seaborn comes with clean, attractive themes (e.g., darkgrid, whitegrid, ticks using the set_style function) that make plots visually appealing with minimal code.\n\nStatistical plotting built-in\n\nSeaborn understands DataFrames and categorical variables. Functions like lineplot, barplot, and boxplot automatically handle grouping (hue, col, row) and aggregation (mean, confidence intervals), which saves a lot of manual coding.\n\nGreat for quick exploratory plots\n\nWith just one line of code, you can generate complex plots that summarize trends, distributions, or relationships. Perfect for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and quick insights."

The only difference is that the matplotlib library sets the plot using plt.plot, while the seaborn library uses sns.lineplot. Seaborn also requires a x= and y= phrase in sns.lineplot while plt.plot can just have the data in order of x then y. I did add the marker=“o” for both libraries to make the data more visually appealing, but it is not required in the default graph. One things that is different is that the seaborn plot automatically adds lines between the different points while you would have to specifiy that with the matplotlib library."

The tips dataset is a dataset built into the seaborn library so we will use it for both graphs, but for the matplotlib graph, we will still only use functions from the matplotlib library. The main bits of code that the matplotlib library implemented to have the same graph as the seaborn library plot were the plt.get_camp(), and the for loop going through the different information. With this dataset, the matplotlib library needed the for loop seperate lines for each day of the week. The for loop splits the data by day, plots each subset with its own color, and manually adds a line. Seaborn is really covenient here because it does all this automatically with the hue function. Seaborn will also automatically choose styles based off of the hue function. We can specify the line type here to make it the same as the matplotlib plot, but without it, it would just choose one that it thinks looks the best. Seaborn also has the set_style() function that allows us to change the look of the entire plot. With darkgrid it gives you a dark background grid with white lines. Seaborn is built on matplotlib so it does still use the same method of assigning titles and axes as the matplotlib library.\n\n\n\nWhich One Is Better?\nThat really depends on what you want to do and the data you are graphing. If you want to customize every little thing in the graph, plotting functions such as cos or sin, or using very large datasets, matplotlib library is usually better. Seaborn is typically better if you just want a quick look at the data since it automatically adds colors and organizes the data on the graph in a neat way. It’s also more useful if you’re using a pandas dataframe and want statistical graphs that are beautiful. I invite you all to try out the matplotlib and seaborn library by asking AI for a dataset you can use to use the different features to see which one you prefer."

You might be confused that the percentages don’t add up to 100%, but remember that each movie has multiple genres, so the percentages are only out of the total, not discounting other genres. There is overlap with the different genres and movies counted in each one. There are a total of 10,000 movies in the sample.\n\n\n\nGenre\n2025 Movies\nMovies since 2016\n\n\n\n\nThriller\n37%\n24%\n\n\nDrama\n34%\n42%\n\n\nComedy\n33%\n33%\n\n\nAction\n30%\n19%\n\n\nHorror\n18%\n16%\n\n\n\nFor 2025, the thriller genre has been the most common genre, with 37% of movies (totaling 139 movies) having this genre. Drama follows up behind it with 34% (totaling 125 movies). Both of these genres are often accompanies with each other and other genres. For example, most romance movies also have drama. Action and horror movies will often include thriller as well, and those genres are also in the top 5.\nLooking at all the movies in the last 10 years, it seems that drama was also a very popular genre, being at 42% (totaling 4202 movies), while action and thrillers weren’t as popular. This gives us some insights as to today’s culture where people have lower attention spans which may be a leading cause to action and thriller movies being more popular.\n\nGenres by Ranking\nBecause there were so many thriller and drama movies, I expected those genres to be the highest ranking movies. However, genres that weren’t even on the top 5 for amount of movies produced with that genre were ranked the highest. For 2025, the animation genre had the highest average ratings (7.28 avg rating). Since 2016, documentaries had the highest average rating (7.11 avg rating). The documentary rating really surprised me because in my personal life I’ve rarely watched documentaries and don’t know many people who enjoy watching documentaries. The ratings are a weighted average of votes on the movie, so it may be that only people who are interested in documentaries are voting on them, inflating that score.\n\n\nTime Series Plot\nIn order to look at how the highest rated genre at changed over time, I made a time series plot showing this. \n\n\nGenres by Popularity\nIn order to see if the ratings were inflated, I also looked at the popularity of different genres. Popularity is determined by the total number of page views on the site for each movie so it may not completely represent if people are enjoying the movie, but that many people are watching the movie. Popularity is usually skewed towards newer movies since most people only visit IMDb to read summaries, reviews, and post reviews for new movies. Because of this, I will only look at genre popularity for movies released in 2025. Looking at popularity, I got different results from what rankings show. The fantasy genre is the most popular (54.7 avg) while the documentary genre is the least popular (2.3). This reinforces my belief that the documentary genre most likely has the highest average rating because the majority of people who are voting for the ranking of documentaries enjoy watching them."

    "text": "Summary\nFrom the analysis that I was able to do, I was able to find that the current most popular genres are most likely fantasy and animation. These genres have been producing high rated movies is the last couple of years. This can be due to the continual rise in digital imaging, allowing for better animation. This makes the movies easier to create and better to watch as well. Fantasy has been a popular genre, which is unsuprising considering the widespread popular movies since 2016 such as the Avengers movies. Just looking at highest rated movies on average wasn’t very helpful as it could be extremely skewed with low view counts but high ratings. The most useful was to compare ratings and popularity to see what genres the fans were enjoying. These were fantasy and animation. Looking at the proportion table and count of movies was useful to see what genres Hollywood wanted to focus on and wanted to produce. We saw that within the last 10 years, there has been an increase in the percentage of movies that are considered action and thrillers, showcasing today’s culture and interest in fast-paced movies."
